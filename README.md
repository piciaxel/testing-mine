Here are some best practice tips for creating a decision tree diagram:

*Start the tree. Draw a rectangle near the left edge of the page to 
represent the first node. In this rectangle, write the first step that 
will lead to a decision.
*Add branches. For every possible alternative draw a separate line that 
begins at the node and moves away toward the right of the page. 
*Add leaves. The bulk of the decision tree will be leaf nodes. At the 
end of each branch add a leaf node. Fill each of these leaf nodes with 
another question or criterion.
*Add more branches. Repeat the process of adding a branch for each 
possible alternative leading from a leaf. Label each branch just as before.
*Complete the decision tree. Continue adding leaves and branches until 
every question or criterion has been resolved and an outcome has been reached.
*Terminate a branch. Continue adding leaves and branches until every 
question or criterion has been resolved and an outcome has been reached.
*Verify accuracy and check if it is possible to make it smaller.
```
Notes:
1. A algorithmic decision tree can have loops. Make sure all loops can end.
2. Try representing familiar algorithms as decision trees (helps understanding).
